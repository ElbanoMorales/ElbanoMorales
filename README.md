### Elbano Morales

My career and roles have made me a multidisciplinary individual with long experience collecting, transforming, and organizing data for analysis to help informed decisions. I started programming after graduating in 2014, and have extensive proven experience with matlab, JavaScript, VBA, C#, SQL, R; and  good understanding of HTML and CSS. I bear excellent understanding and proficiency of platforms for effective data analyses, including SQL and spreadsheets, and always base my analyses on core subjects like satistics, algebra and calculus. I love studying and practicing everyday and I'm looking to collaborate on projects that help my career grow in programming and data sciences.
